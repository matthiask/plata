Plata - the lean and mean Django-based Shop
===========================================

Instead of fighting against a big and all-knowing shop system, which
never does the right thing although it "only requires pushing a few
configuration buttons here and there", Plata only provides order,
payment and discount models. Building a shop on top of Django
and Plata requires programming -- but that's what we do -- programming!
