Shipping
========

This (new and still incomplete) module will provide the calculation of shipping
costs, depending on the size and weight of your products.

You can register the tariffs of several shipping providers (postal services)
for groups of countries that cost the same postage and several package sizes.

Setup:

* Include `plata.shipping` in your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
* Run `manage.py makemigrations shipping` and `manage.py migrate`.
* Login to your admin interface and ...
* Create some country groups – the first will be your home country, others
  depend on the tariff groups of your shipping provider, like "European Union",
  "World 1", "World 2" etc.
* Define the countries that belong to these groups.
* Setup the shipping providers you work with, depending on the countries they
  serve.
* At last it’s the most work to register all the different postage tariffs.

Some providers have maximum sizes for each dimension (length, weidth, height),
others calculate by adding these. Some calculate by "tape measure", i.e.
combined length and girth (in German: Gurtmaß), you must translate that to our
"3D" sum yourself.
`Postage.max_size` is the smaller of either the sum of length, width and height
or `max_3d`.

Because also the packaging has a considerable weight that depends on the package
size, this is also a property of `Postage`. If you don’t need it, leave it at 0.


Configuration
=============

You can change the displayed units, e.g. if someone insists in obsolete
non-metric units::

    PLATA_SHIPPING_WEIGHT_UNIT = 'g'
    PLATA_SHIPPING_LENGTH_UNIT = 'mm'
